        <p>A very recluse, misanthropic, and perceptive Brown Tiefling Warlock. Ackamemnon
            wanders in search of a place to be truly away from the annoyance of the world,
            ironically followed by his patron, former Archdevil Moloch. Being raised on the
            streets, he understands both what it means to be quickhanded and shunned from
            society. Oddly enough, finding his only true friend and companion on this path
            being a small rat named Istus.</p>
