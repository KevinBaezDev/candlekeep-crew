            <p>
                The Candlekeep Crew are a band of misfit adventurers from all walks
                of life. What first began as a "wrong place, wrong time" scenario for
                each member, is slowly turning into a quirky place of belonging. Each
                party member brings their own set of strengths and weaknesses, however,
                through trial and error, the party is slowly learning how to balance
                each other out. While the crew may be fresh off the forge, there's no
                doubt that their tale will be a long one full of adventure, danger,
                and treasure...
