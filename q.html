        <p>Q ran away from his Monastery and disguised himself as a wandering
            bard trying to fulfill his wanderlust. In an attempt to make up
            for his lost years in the past as a slave and secluded sage monk.
            A "bit" hyperactive and friendly, he's always willing to try new
            things, and has a minor superiority complex in battle.</p>
