    <body>
        <p>A very bubbly, educated, beautiful and Intelligent Half-Elf Wizard, born to
            Stella the Elf and Hankford the Human. He was very protected in his youth and
            spent most his time studying with his mother, Stella, at home while his father,
            a woodworker, supported them. Dale would then venture out on his own at the
            ripe age of 30, deciding there is more to this world than his twin sized bed,
            Dwarven paraphernalia, and his loving parents.</p>
